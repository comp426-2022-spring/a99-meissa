# Project Description

Food Poisoning is an issue, which over 48 million Americans experience each year. In order to help combat this issue, we have developed a food poisoning tracker that will allow people to search their location, find reports of restaurants giving individuals food poisoning, and avoid contaminated food. This tracker will also allow these individuals to post their own experiences.
